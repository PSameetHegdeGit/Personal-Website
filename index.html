        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>
            I am a first year software engineer who strives to learn the art of writing clean and maintainable code. 
            In learning about clean code design, I actively read material on design principles, especially those relevant to object-oriented programming languages.
            My technical interests include distributed systems engineering, and I design data intensive applications in my free time.
        </p>
        <p>
            After graduating Rutgers University New Brunswick with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics, I joined Silverwork Solutions,
            a fintech startup specializing in robotic process automation. It is a challenging and interesting place to work, and the problems I tackle 
            have helped me grow as an engineer. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from day to day programming, I enjoy fitness, soccer, piano, and cooking. I am also a tutor at Tutoring Chicago where I teach 5th grade Math
            and English. I also hope to train for a half marathon and partake in a solo backpacking trip to Europe!
        </p>
        <p>
            I am looking to connect with people to talk about the technology space. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.

                        <h5>LSM Storage Engine</h5>
                        <p> I implemented a log-structured merge tree based storage engine. A memtable for in memory storage was used. 
                            I provided three options for memtable representation: AVL tree, red black tree, and binary search tree. After a memtable size limit was reached,
                            the memtable was flushed into a segment file stored on disk. Periodically, segment files would be compacted and merged to remove 
                            duplicate data entries, which thereby reduced disk memory usage. Additionally a write ahead log was implemented to backup in-memory memtable in the case 
                            of a crash.

                        <h5>Collision Detection and Resolution</h5>
                        <p> We randomly generated two dimensional prisms over a grid. We then used the GJK algorithm, based on taking the Minkowski difference and triple cross product of prisms,
                            to find intersections between them. For those prisms that have an intersection, we found the minimal vector needed to separate intersecting prisms.
                            This was based on the EPA algorithm. We completed this project in order to understand fundamental mechanics of collision detection and separation in video games.

                            to perform some analytics on the data and communicate with a MongoDB database (I use to store some user
                            information). Additionally, although NewsAPI sends data in a JSON format anyway, I wanted to reformat the data 
                            so that it would be easier to render this data into html.

                            The algorithm follows the traditional simplex algorithm and is programmed in python. The backend runs
                            on a flask server deployed to Heroku. I developed a minimalistic user interface with vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

                        <p>
                            This Unity game simulates the frequency of specific genotypes in a population over generations. In this world,
                            we make several assumptions of the environment as well as the population such that the population's genotypic
                            frequencies in some later generation stays consistent. This consistency is the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium.
                            The Unity game is coded with c# and communicates with a Flask backend. This Flask backend takes several parameters
                            from the game and uses these values to determine a random genotypic frequency and the changes in this genotypic frequency
                            over time (these frequencies eventually reach the Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium).
