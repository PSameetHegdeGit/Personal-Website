        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>
            I am a senior at Rutgers University studying computer science and mathematics.
            I'm currently looking for full time opportunities in software engineering. 
        </p>


        <p>

            In my time at Rutgers, I've assumed roles in a variety of sectors. As a Development intern at Spectrum360, a nonprofit organization that serves children, 
            adolescents, young adults, and adults on the autism spectrum, I developed technologies that would help in coordinating events. 
            As a Research Assistant for a lab in my university's Psychology department, I created programmatic solutions to reduce workload and create 
            visualizations. As a software engineering intern at Cigna, I developed
            new features to automate tasks for developers at the company. I've also served as treasurer for my university's financial
            branch, programming coordinator for my university's primary prehealth club, and as a mentor to incoming students at Rutgers Honors College.
        </p>
        <p>
           No matter the role or the business, I always want to find new ways to incorporate technology. Currently, I'm still interning at 
           Cigna. I'm also working on an app that I hope will improve student engagement at Rutgers, and
           I'm further exploring data sciences by learning more about pandas, numpy, statistics, and data visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from coding, I like soccer, going to the gym, playing piano, and have recently gotten into cooking as well.
            I'm also training for a marathon!
